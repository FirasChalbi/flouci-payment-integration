/**
 * The **Orders API** allows you to use Mollie for your order management.
 *
 * For each order in your shop, you can create an order via the Mollie API. The order will remain valid for a certain amount of time (default 28 days).
 *
 * Just as a regular payment, the order will have a `_links.checkout` property where you can redirect your customer to pay for the order. For each attempt to pay, a payment object is created. If the
 * customer pays for the order, the order will transition to the `paid` state (or `authorized` in case of Klarna payment methods).
 *
 * Should the initial payment fail, the order remains in the `created` state so that your customer can try to pay again. This can be done using a dedicated link available through the Dashboard which
 * you can share with your customer, or you can create an additional payment on the order via the API.
 *
 * Once you ship the goods to your customer, you should inform Mollie of the shipments via the API or via the Dashboard. This is mandatory for pay-after-delivery methods. Only shipped amounts will be
 * settled to your account.
 *
 * The following payment methods require the Orders API and cannot be used with the Payments API:
 *
 * -   *Pay after delivery* payment methods, such as Klarna Pay later, Klarna Slice it and in3
 * -   Klarna Pay now
 * -   Eco vouchers, gift vouchers, and meal vouchers
 *
 * @see https://docs.mollie.com/orders/overview#orders-api
